= Heroku Release

Simple RubyGem for tagging and deploying versioned releases of an application to Heroku with the ability to do rollbacks.

== Usage

If you are using Bundler, add a gem dependency like this:

 group :development, :test do
   gem 'heroku_release', '~> version known to work'
 end

Require the Rake tasks in your Rakefile:

 require 'heroku_release/tasks'

You have a few configuration options. If you are using a Git remote other than "heroku" then you must configure that. You can choose to have the release version written to a file on deploy so you can check the version on the live server. You can also choose to have a CHANGELOG file auto-generated. Here is a configuration example:

 HerokuRelease.config.heroku_remote = "production" # git remote for heroku, defaults to "heroku"
 HerokuRelease.config.version_file_path = "public/version" # if not set no version file will be generated
 HerokuRelease.config.changelog_path = "CHANGELOG" # if not set no changelog file will be generated
 HerokuRelease.config.branch = 'production' # defaults to 'master'

To deploy the master branch to production, use the heroku_release rake task:

 rake heroku_release COMMENT="This is a comment describing what changed since the last release"

To deploy another branch to production, send the BRANCH env variable:
 rake heroku_release BRANCH="production_branch"

If the deploy went horribly wrong and you need to do a rollback you can do so:

 rake heroku_release:rollback

In order to see the changelog:

 rake heroku_release:log

To examine git commits since the last release you can do:

 rake heroku_release:pending

== TODO

It seems Heroku {is working on}[http://github.com/adamwiggins/heroku-releases] incorporating rollback functionality into the heroku command. Something to look into...
